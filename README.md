I have done this project by myself.
I downloaded the data from kaggle.com and followed the instructions given in the website page.
I tried to analyze the most valuable product and worst selling product from the data to take actions against the poor performance. 
I also indentified the trends with area chart where I showed the four years sales curves followed the same trends every year and increases the sales in the last 6months of every year while at the beginning 6 months, there is low trends in sales. 
Finally,recommended to address the possible areas where comapany should focus on.
